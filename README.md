# Employee-Database-App
This is an app that uses a command line interface to manipulate and report out information from a database that stores employees' professional and work information. 

# Motivation
This project was completed as part of the Michigan State University/Trilogy Web Development Bootcamp program, and is one of the most rewarding projects I've completed so far. Working with SQL to organize and improve data sets is a powerful toolset, and the skills that I practiced here--including working with SQL, MySQL, and node.js interfaces--greatly improved my skills in these areas.

# Screenshots
Here is a gif of the final working process for the application.

# Tech/Framwork
This application uses MySql, node.js, SQL, javascript, and CLI prompts. 

# Installation and Usage
To try the app out, do an npm install to pull out the inquirer, mysql, and console.table dependencies.

Also, make sure you run the SQL code from seed.sql in MySQL or a similar program to create the database that the app will pull from. There are around 10 items in each of the three database tables.
